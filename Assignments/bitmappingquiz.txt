Raj Pabari Bitmapping Quiz

1. This is about the time that many people learning to program run into problems
   with Windows hiding file extensions. Briefly explain how to make Windows show
   file extensions. If you don't remember, go back to the ``Before getting started''
   section.
 
I am using a Mac instead of a Windows machine. In VSCode, the file explorer always shows
the file extension. In the settings of Mac's file explorer, there is a setting to show file extensions.

2. (5 pts) For the following file extensions:
 
    
   * .jpg - PHOTOS
   * .wav - UNCOMPRESSED SOUNDS
   * .gif - GRAPHIC ART
   * .png - GRAPHIC ART
   * .ogg - SOUNDS
   * .bmp - UNCOMPRESSED IMAGES
   * .mp3 - SOUNDS
    
   ...match the extension to the category it best fits:
    
   * Photos
   * Graphic art
   * Uncompressed images
   * Songs and sound effects
   * Uncompressed sounds
    
3. Should an image be loaded inside the main program loop, or before it?
   Should the program blit the image in the main program loop or before it?
 
An image should be loaded before the main program loop, but blit inside the loop.

4. How can a person change an image from one format to another? For example, how
   do you change a .jpg to a .gif? Why does changing the file extension not really
   work? (Ask if you can't figure it out.)
 
Using simple online tools, it's easy to change file extensions. However,
the reason for not using JPGs is that they slightly change the colors, and converting
to a PNG or GIF after the colors have been distorted by a JPG doesn't serve much purpose.

5. Explain why an image that was originally saved as a .jpg doesn't work with
   setting a background color even after it is converted to a .png.
 
JPGs distort the background color slightly, and converting to a PNG doesn't fix this distortion.

6. Briefly explain how to play background music in a game, and how to
   automatically start playing a new song when the current song ends.
   Check the ``examples'' section, and look under the graphics examples
   for example code on how to do this.

You can play the next queued song from the main program loop if the current song is finished.
If the current song is not finished, do nothing and continue playing it.
