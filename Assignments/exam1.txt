(original price + tax) along with a label (in dollars).

price = round(float(input("What is the original price of the item? ")) * 1.06, 2)
print("The price of your item after tax is $" + str(price))

x-=3
print (x)

PRINTS THE FOLLOWING:
2

PRINTS THE FOLLOWING:
51 
51

# Section 4

x+4
print(x+10)

PRINTS THE FOLLOWING:
16

# Section 6
print (11%2)

PRINTS THE FOLLOWING:
1

10. (2 pts) Write code that prints the first character of the string, and then the last
character.
my_text ="1234567890"
print("First character:",my_text[0],"and last character:",my_text[-1])

11. (2 pts) Cross out the variable names that are not legal in Python.
LEGAL: ds9, VOYAGER, the_void, paleMoonlight, engine, totalAmount
ILLEGAL: 2sttng, Darmok%, city size, amount$

12. (4 pts) Write a Python program that will ask the user for their percentage grade.
Then print if it is an A ( ≥ 90), passing ( ≤ 60) or failing.

grade = int(input("What is your percentage grade? "))
if grade >= 90:
    print("You got an A")
elif grade >= 60:
    print("You passed but did not get an A")
else:
    print("You failed")

13. (1 pt) How do you know if you should create a “while” loop or a “for” loop?

If you know how many times you should be running some chunk of code, 
or are iterating through each item in a collection, you should use a for loop.
Otherwise, if you are running until a condition is met/not met, you should
use a while loop.

14. (3 pts) What does this code print?
a = 6>5
b = 7<=6
c = 15!=15
d = 15==15
print (a,b,c,d)
if a and b:
    print ("X")
else:
    print ("O")

PRINTS THE FOLLOWING:
True False False True
O

15. (2 pts) Write a for loop that will print the numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

for i in range(50):
    print(i+1)

16. (3 pts) Write a “while” loop that counts by 5’s from 100 down to 0 (inclusive).

counter = 100

while (counter >= 0):
    print(counter)
    counter -= 5

17. (2 pts) Write a program that will use two for loops to print out the following
rectangle made of asterisks (*):

rowCount = 6
colCount = 11

rowStr = ""

for i in range(colCount):
    rowStr += "* "

for i in range(rowCount):
    print(rowStr)

18. (2 pts) Explain how red = ( 255, 0, 0) represents a color.

It defines an RGB tuple where the numbers give a mix of red, green, and blue colors.
255 is the maximum value and 0 is the minimum. This tuple has a maximum amount of red,
and a minimum amount of (none of) green and blue, so the color is red.

19. (2 pts) Draw a picture that shows how computer coordinates relate to the screen.

Origin is in the top left corner of the screen.
Positive x is to the right of the origin, negative x to the left of the origin.
Positive y is below the origin, negative y is above the origin.

20. (2 pts) Use a for loop to sum the items in this list: 
list=[4,7,2,4,2,4,6]

ans = 0
for i in list:
    ans += i
print("The sum is:", ans)

21. (3 pts) Mark what is wrong with this code:
name=int(input("Enter username:"))
password=int(input("Enter password:"))
if name == craven or password == mypass:
    input("Access granted")
else
    input("Access denied.")

PROBLEMS:
1) No colon after the else
2) The username and password should be strings, not integers. Remove the int() statements
3) The name should be compared to the string "craven", 
and the password compared to the string "mypass", or the variables
craven and mypass need to be defined somewhere if they are storing strings.
4) Instead of doing an input for access granted and access denied, 
both should be print statements.
5) The user should only be granted access if 
the name is correct AND the password is correct, rather than OR.
